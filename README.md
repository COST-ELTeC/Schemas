# Schemas

Current versions of the ELTeC schema in RELAX NG  are available from this repository

To check whether a text is valid against an ELTeC schema in oXygen, insert a PI like the following at the
start of the document:

```
<?xml-model href="https://COST-ELTEC/Schemas/eltec-1.rng" ?>
```
Alternatively, clone this repository to your local filestore.

For authoritative documentation, derived from the TEI ODD from which the schemas are derived, see
