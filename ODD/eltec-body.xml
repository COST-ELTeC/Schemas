   <p>This reference document defines the encoding scheme to be used for the European Literary Text
      Collection (ELTeC) which will be a major deliverable of COST Action 16204, <title>Distant
         Reading</title>. All texts included in the ELTeC should be conformant to the schema
      described by this document. </p>
   <div>
      <head>Principles</head>
      <p>The MoU for the project notes that <q>Distant Reading methods cover a wide range of
            computational methods for literary text analysis, such as authorship attribution, topic
            modelling, character network analysis, or stylistic analysis.</q> The focus of the ELTeC
         encoding scheme is therefore not to represent texts in all their original complexity of
         structure or appearance, but rather to facilitate a richer and better-informed distant
         reading than a transcription of lexical content alone would permit. In designing this
         encoding scheme, we have applied the following principles: <list>
            <item>There should be a guaranteed minimum level of encoding for all texts in the
               ELTeC.</item>
            <item>The encoding should reflect the analytic needs of <soCalled>distant
                  reading</soCalled>, rather than those of the digital editor.</item>
            <item>At the same time, the encoding should not misrepresent the text as originally
               created and received.</item>
            <item>The encoding must be easy to apply in a consistent way, starting from both basic
               OCR and pre-existing digital versions.</item>
         </list> The goal is not to duplicate the work of scholarly editors or to produce (yet
         another) digital edition of a specific source document. Rather it is to ensure that the
         ELTeC texts can be processed satisfactorily, even by simple minded (but XML-aware) systems
         primarily concerned with lexis, and to make life easier for the developers of such systems. </p>

      <p>In selecting features for inclusion in the markup scheme, we have been guided, but not
         limited, by existing practice as far as possible. Our main goal has been to identify a
         small core set of textual features which can be readily (preferably automatically)
         identified in existing digital transcriptions, or easily and consistently provided by new
         transcriptions. </p>

      <p>We distinguish three <soCalled>levels</soCalled> of encoding, referred to below as level
         zero, level one and level two. All ELTeC texts are made available at level zero, the basic
         encoding format. Some texts may additionally be made available at levels one or two, which
         provide a richer set of encoded features. For example: a level one text will include
         semantic information missing from a level zero text; a level two text will include
         tokenization information missing from a level one text. As far as possible conversion
         between levels will be automatically scripted, but this is not possible in the general
         case. </p>
      <p>This document lists all the textual features which are to be distinguished in an ELTeC
         conformant transcription at one of these three levels. Whenever a given feature exists in a
         text, it will be marked up as indicated here. No other features will be captured by the
         markup: if some textual feature not provided for here is identified by a marked up source
         text, that markup will be removed (though it may be retained in a version of the text
         encoded at a different level). </p>

      <p>All ELTeC documents are TEI conformant, and therefore include a TEI Header, as discussed in
         section <ptr target="#hdr"/> below.</p>


   </div>
   <div>
      <head>Basic Transcription Guidelines (all levels) </head>
      <p>The basic unit of the ELTeC collection is a single novel, represented by a single
            <gi>TEI</gi> element, consisting of a <gi>teiHeader</gi> element containing metadata
         specific to that novel and a <gi>text</gi> element containing a normalised transcription of
         the text itself. We propose no mechanism (other than metadata) to encode units larger than
         a single novel, such as multipart novel series like Proust's <title>A la recherche du temps
            perdu</title> or Balzac's <title>Les Rougon-Macquart</title>. Each text should be
         transcribed in full from a specific identifiable edition, typically the first, and the
         source documented in the TEI Header. The original spelling and punctuation of the source
         should be retained, but details of typography are not required: hence words hyphenated
         across line or page breaks should be silently reassembled. </p>
      <!-- page breaks-->
      <p>To facilitate checking of a transcription against its source during production, the
            <gi>pb</gi> element may be provided to mark the point in a transcription where a new
         page begins in the source. An identifier for each <gi>pb</gi> element may be provided in a
         level 1 text to facilitate linkage to a page image of the corresponding source page, but is
         not required in a level 0 text. </p>
      <p>Running titles, page footers, catchwords and other forms of printed paratext are all
         omitted from an ELTeC transcription, with the exception of a page number, which should be
         supplied as value of the <att>n</att> attribute. Note that this attribute supplies the page
         number as specified by the source. If no page number is given, the value should be enclosed
         in brackets. </p>
      <p> If a page begins with the second part of a hyphenated word, the <gi>pb</gi> tag may appear
         after that word in order to simplify lexical processing. Otherwise its position should be the
         same in transcription and source. </p>
      <!-- liminal material -->
      <p>As well as a titlepage or a table of contents, a published novel often includes material
         such as forewords or appendixes additional to the text of the novel itself. This
            <term>liminal</term> matter is included in an ELTeC text only if it is believed to be
         authorial. Material before the body of the text begins is collected within a <gi>front</gi>
         element, and material following the body in a <gi>back</gi> element. In either case,
         distinct sections of the material, if encoded, are represented by a <gi>div</gi> with its
            <att>type</att> attribute set to <code>liminal</code>.</p>
      <p>At level zero, titlepages and tables of contents are omitted. At level one, they are
         replaced by a <gi>gap</gi> element. Non-authorial liminal material is silently omitted at
         all levels. </p>
      <!-- body divisions -->
      <p>Within the body of a text, major structural divisions (parts, sections, chapters etc.) will
         be captured using the generic <gi>div</gi> element, with attributes <att>type</att>,
            <att>xml:lang</att>, <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att> used as further detailed
         below.</p>
      <p>The names used for hierarchic structural divisions of a novel above the chapter are
         arbitrary, culture-specific, and often inconsistent : in some novels things called
            <q>part</q> contain things called <q>book</q> and in others the reverse. We propose to
         follow TEI in using a single element (<gi>div</gi>) for every hierarchical structural
         division, down to the level of <q>chapter</q>.</p>
      <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is used to indicate the function of a structural division. It
         should have one of the following values:
        <list type="gloss">
           <label>liminal</label><item>authorial preface, foreword, back matter, etc.</item>
           <label>titlepage</label><item>(within front or back) contains title page text: level 1 only</item>
           <label>notes</label><item>(within front or back) contains authorial notes : level 1 only</item>
           <label>part</label><item>any structural subdivision of a text larger than a chapter e.g. part, volume etc.</item>
           <label>chapter</label><item>smallest structural subdivision of the body of a text</item>
        </list></p> 
         <p>A short novel may have no subdivision at all, in which case the <gi>div</gi> element should not be used.
            No further subdivisions within a <tag>div type='chapter'</tag> are permitted. If the text of a chapter is subdivided
            in some way, for example by means of a number, a row of stars, a horizontal rule, or similar
            device, this should be indicated in the markup by means of a <gi>milestone</gi> element. If a chapter
            contains an embedded text of some kind, for example a quoted letter or other narrative, this should be
            marked using the <gi>quote</gi> element. 
            </p>

      <p>The (human) language in which a text is expressed is indicated explicitly by the
            <att>xml:lang</att> attribute which supplies the ISO 641-2 letter code for the language
         concerned. This attribute will always be supplied on the <gi>text</gi> element to specify a
         default, and may also appear on other elements to indicate passages where the language
         changes. The various different languages used in a given text will be itemized in its
         metadata (see <gi>langUsage</gi> element in the header). </p>
      <p>A single reference scheme will be defined for the whole corpus, with the following
         components: <list>
            <item>text identifier : every text will have an identifier consisting of its three letter
               language code in upper case and a five digit serial number, for example
                  <code>FRA00042</code></item>
            <item>chapter identifier: each chapter or equivalent will have an identifier
               concatenating the text identifier and a three digit serial number, for example
                  <code>FR042012</code> is the twelfth chapter of the 42nd French novel. </item>
            <item>If sub-chapter segmentation is implemented, then the segments will append a
               further four digit serial number.</item>
            <item>liminal divisions are not identified; the front element has an identifier
               concatenating the text identifier and the value 000; the back element has an
               identifier concatenating the text identifier and the value 999.</item>
         </list>The identifier will be supplied as the value of an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on
         each <gi>text</gi>, <gi>div</gi>, front, back, or <gi>s</gi> element as appropriate. Adding
         this identifier is an easily automated task built into the workflow for accession to the
         ELTeC.</p>
      <p>Note that these identifiers will not necessarily correspond with the numbering used in a
         particular source text. In a work where the first twelve chapters are considered to form
         part one, and the next twelve constitute part two, the first chapter of the second part
         will have an identifier ending <code>013</code>, even though it may be numbered
            <code>1</code> in a source text.</p>
      <p>We do not preserve the lineation of running prose in our source texts, since this is always
         purely an artefact of the source edition. For the same reason we reassemble words broken
         across a line break, silently removing any hyphen present. (This will make it impossible to
         use our texts for hyphenation studies. So be it.) </p>
      <p>The title of a chapter, or of any other subdivision, as given in the source should be
         encoded using the TEI <gi>head</gi> element. There may be more than one such element at the
         start of a <gi>div</gi> element. Novels occasionally include other initial matter, such as
         a quotation, or a summary of the content of the chapter; these are not specially treated in
         ELTeC texts. </p>
      <p>The chapters of a novel mostly consist of prose, arranged in paragraphs. It is not unusual
         to find other structures however, specifically verse, or passages of dialogue presented as
         if in a play, with speaker labels and even stage directions. Less frequently, novels may
         contain material presented in list or tabular formats. Graphics with their own associated
         heading or other text are also frequent. </p>
      <p>Novels are also full of direct speech, represented using various different conventions, but
         almost always distinguished from the narrative voice. The first person narrative is also
         common, but may be regarded as a special case. How exactly different narrative strands are
         articulated in a novel, and the extent to which they may be characterised by their lexis
         has been a preoccupation of many <q>distant reading</q> style analyses. Although it might
         be helpful to distinguish material purporting to be direct speech from material purporting
         to be narrative in our basic encoding, doing so consistently and accurately would be
         problematic. ELTeC texts therefore do no more than preserve existing punctuation. The
            <gi>p</gi> element is used for everything which is typeset as a separate block on the
         page, including both paragraphs and list items; the <gi>l </gi>element is used for verse
         lines or similar, typically set off from the rest of the text. Illustrations and any
         associated text such as a title or heading are excluded. Passages set as if in drama are
         not specially treated. </p>
      <p>Printed texts typically deploy a number of conventions which can cause problems for
         linguistic analyses of even the most basic kind. Changes of font or style (italicization or
         use of superscript, for example) usually signal something, which an analysis should take
         into account. However, determining the function of such typographic variation is not always
         straightforward. ELTeC texts (at level 0) therefore simply indicate the presence of
         typographic salience, using the <gi>hi</gi> element.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
      <head>Transcription Guidelines (level 1)</head>
      <p>ELTeC encoding at level zero aims above all for consistency and transparency in what is
         reliably achievable, leaving most problematic issues to be addressed by linguistic
         annotation. </p>
      <p>If however a text has been derived from a digital version in which a more ambitious range
         of textual features has already been captured, whether by means of TEI-style markup or
         styling information such as that provided by Word, or if there are sufficient resources
         available to provide a slightly reacher encoded version, a novel may be encoded at ELTeC
         level 1, using additional elements discussed in this section. Note that a level one text
         can always automatically be converted to a level zero text, if this is necessary for
         compatibility or for some other reason. (A script to do this is available <ref
            target="https://distantreading.github.io/Scripts/detagger.xsl">on the project
            website</ref>) The reverse conversion, from level zero to level one, requires human
         intervention. </p>
      <p>At level 1, the element <gi>gap</gi> should be used to indicate when something has been
         omitted from the encoding. For example, a suppressed graphic, or foreword, which at level
         zero are silently omitted, should be represented at level 1 by an explicit <gi>gap</gi> element, with
         attributes indicating what has been omitted from the encoding.</p>
      <p>At level 1, the following additional elements can be used to mark up the significance of
         some stretch of text which would otherwise simply be marked as typographically salient
         using <gi>hi</gi>: <list>
            <label><gi>foreign</gi></label>
            <item>a word or phrase in a foreign language</item>
            <label>
               <gi>title</gi></label>
            <item>the title of a book, piece of music, etc.</item>
            <label>
               <gi>label</gi></label>
            <item>any form of heading or label found within a paragraph of text</item>
            <label><gi>emph</gi></label>
            <item>a word or phrase being linguistically emphasized e.g. by being shouted</item>
         </list> The <gi>hi</gi> is also sometimes used for indications of superscript characters
         (such as French <soCalled>14&#x1d49;</soCalled>); these should simply be removed.
         <!--Instead, the TEI element
                        <gi>abbr</gi> should be used to indicate the presence of an abbreviated
                     word: <code><gi>abbr</gi>14e&lt;/abbr></code>-->
      </p>
      <p>When a sequence of verse lines, or a passage from some other narrative level such as a
         letter is quoted within a text, the <gi>l</gi> or <gi>p</gi> elements representing it
         should be wrapped in the <gi>quote</gi> element made available by the ELTeC level one
         schema.</p>
      <p>It is not unusual to find special devices such as a row of stars or a rule in the middle of
         a chapter, usually indicating a discontinuity in the narrative timeline, or structural
         shift. Such indications may be simply ignored in an ELTeC level zero text, or the
         special purpose <gi>milestone</gi> element may be used to mark their presence; at level 1
         they should be retained.</p>
      <p>Level 1 texts may also represent authorial notes, if these are present, using the element
            <gi>note</gi> to contain the body of the note, and the element <gi>ref</gi> to represent
         the point of attachment for the note. Wherever they appear in the text, notes are always
         separated from it and encoded in a separate <gi>div</gi> element within the <gi>back</gi>
         element. See examples. </p>
      <p>Occasionally, the text being transcribed contains self-evident errors. Where these are
         caused by the encoding process (e.g. an OCR error), these are always silently corrected in
         the transcription. Where however the original itself is faulty, however, and the
         transcriber (or a textual editor) has corrected it, the correction should be signalled by
         using the <gi>corr</gi> element available at level one. </p>

      <head>Metadata in the TEI Header</head>

      <p>This section describes the metadata associated with each text (title, authorship, date
         etc.) and with the collection as a whole. The intention is to provide this in a
         standardised way to facilitate subsetting of the collection, using (for example) coded
         values for the descriptive selection criteria associated with the text. As far as possible,
         our text should represent the first complete printed edition of each novel selected. </p>
      <p>The TEI Header provides a very large number of possibilities for encoding such metadata. We
         will provide a checklist of the TEI Header elements which are always to be provided for
         each text, possibly in the form of a template. As in the body of the text, the intention is
         to provide a guaranteed minimal level of information, consistent across all parts of the
         ELTeC. </p>
      <p>Note that metadata may be supplied at (at least) two levels: the level of the ELTeC as a
         whole, and that of individual texts within it. Information which applies uniformly to all
         parts of the collection should be supplied in the ELTeC header; information specific to a
         particular document in the text header. </p>

      <p>Every ELTeC text includes a TEI Header supplying metadata to describe it. There is also a
         TEI Header for the whole collection, which has additional information common to all the
         texts. This section lists the header components which should be supplied for every text,
         indicating briefly specific usage rules. </p>

      <p>Here is the basic template for an individual ELTeC header: <egXML
            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <teiHeader type="novelHeader">

      <p> Each of the TEI elements shown above must be provided and used as described below. The
         ELTeC schemas will reject as invalid a document in which these conventions are not
         followed. </p>
      <p> The natural language used for text in the Header should be that of the language collection
         to which the text belongs, e.g. French if the text is in French. The attribute @xml:lang
         may be supplied on any element to indicate its content is in some other language where
         necessary. </p>

                     found on the title page. </item>

         <p>The <gi>textDesc</gi> element contains one of each of the following elements from the <ident>model.textDescPart</ident> class

         <specList>
            <specDesc key="model.textDescPart" />

         These elements are used to represent the selection criteria applicable to the current text. They are specific to the ELTeC
         project, and are therefore taken from the ELTeC namespace (<ident>http://distantreading.net/eltec/ns</ident>) rather than
            the TEI namespace.

       <!--  <p> The <gi>textClass</gi> element should contain one <gi>catRef</gi> element, and may also

         <p> The <gi>langUsage</gi> element should contain one or more <gi>language</gi>
            element, one for each of the human languages used in the text. The @ident attribute of
            this element identifies the language using the ISO 639-2 code in the same way as the
            @xml:lang attribute. The @usage attribute may be used to indicate approximately what
            percentage of the text uses this language, or otherwise qualify it by means of a brief description. </p>
         <p>The <gi>textDesc</gi> element contains four  elements defining the selection criteria applicable to
         this text. These are specific to ELTeC and are therefore defined in the ELTeC namespace.</p>

     This text is mostly in Italian, but approximately a tenth of it is taken up with quotations in English, and another tenth with quotations
     in German. Its description indicates that it has a male author, is of low canonicity (i.e. has not been republished after
         its original publication time slot), contains more than 200,000 words, and was first published between 1880 and 1899. </p>

            the date of the change in W3C format (YYYY-MM-DD) and the change elements are given in
            chronological order, most recent first. The content of the element should be a brief
            sentence indicating what was done and who was responsible for doing it, using the
            language of the text. </p>
